### Data Cleaning and Preparations

In the initial phase of the data cleaning and preparations, the following actions were performed on the different technologies used;

#### Excel
  1. Data loading and inspection
  2. Handling missing variables using ISBLANK function in Excel
  3. Eliminating duplicates.
  4. Data cleaning and formatting.

#### SQL
  1. Conversion of the already cleaned data from Excel to a CSV file format, this was to enable importation of the data into SQL quickly and efficiently as opposed to importing an excel       file format directly.
  2. Creating a database (include database creation code here)
  3. Import the SalesData and CustomerData data into the already created database.
  4. Writing amazing codes to show the different trends and patterns in the dataset for making sound decisions (screenshot of the codes).
